Thanks to modern technology and the internet, it is easier than ever to create, publish and access new music. As the amount of available music increases, the blending and creation of new musical genres occurs more and more frequently. We propose a new method of classifying music into genres using clustering techniques on similarity-based album networks. Our proposed method is to construct a similarity-based network according to track feature measures and group the tracks into genres using network clustering. In this paper, we will analyze the effectiveness of this method by comparing the classification resulting from our methods to the ground-truth genres the songs are labeled with. The data we will be using for this analysis is taken from the Free Music Archive, a library of free, legal song downloads paired with song metadata. The metadata contains descriptive labels for thousands of songs, including Echo Nest features such as ‘danceability’ and ‘liveliness’, as well as true genre labels. Referencing our Complex Network Analysis in Python textbook, we will use the Echo Nest features to construct a similarity-based network of the tracks. Then, we will first analyze a few genre sub-graphs to demonstrate the power of this method in learning about music and characterizing genres. Subsequently, we will use spectral clustering and modularity maximization on the network as a whole to obtain communities within this network, which we can interpret as a classification of the tracks into genres. Finally, since our data contains the ground-truth genres for each track, we will analyze the accuracy of our model in obtaining clusters of tracks similar to the true genre labels. We feel that though our results will provide interesting insight into how music is classified, they may be extended to a classification method of any domain.
